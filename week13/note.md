## Goals
Improve analytic statistic and generate better plots.

More specifically:
1. Plot a graph for the first comparison - Default_1b
    - X-axis: # riders , range of [20, 44]
    - Y-axis: percentage of orders dropped, with Mean, 50-percentile, 75-percentile, 25-percentile
    
2. Modify table for the
    - Remove max and min for the first comparison - Default_1b

3. Running average plot for Waiting time for the 2nd comparison: 
    - X-axis should be time 
    - Take a running average, for each interval, eg. 20min
