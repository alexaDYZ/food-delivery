Observation:
1) ClosestToFPT has a similar performance to the baseline
2) For both methods, they never yield satisfactory results(deliver all within 45 min), depite a large number of riders
-  see rider = 70, 80


ClosestToFPT:
for each order:
    - find rider's arrival time @ restaurant
    - pick whoever can reach the closest to the FRT

Reason of Failure:
- when there is a surplus of riders, idle riders reach too early, hence wont be picked
- instead, the busy rider will arrive later, closer to FRT, hence will be picked

Solution:
- given that, the expected distance between any two points in the grid is 0.52*x, for gridSize = x * x
- for
