## Purpose 

Complement the content of the paper.

## Main Results

1. *summary_dropped_100Experiments.xlsx* 
- analyse % orders dropped using Defaut_1a Algo.

2. *summary_WT_2000orders_gridSize1000_FPT30.csv*
- analyse Waiting Time of Default_1b and Anticipative_1
- Setting is specified in the paper
- 100 simulations for each number of riders

3. *./fairness*
- concern raised: unequal distribution of orders among riders, may lead to inequality of salary.
- Feedback: it's due to the design of the Anticipative_1 algorithm. It's normal. Can be an area of improvement but not our focus for this paper.
